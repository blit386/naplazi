# Use dev mode

`BT.isDevMode` tells you whether the game is running as a development build or a release build, so you do not have to
invent your own signal for it.

## When to use

Use when the user wants a debug HUD, cheat key, verbose console logging, or a test fixture (a level-select shortcut, a
god-mode toggle) to work while developing but disappear from a shipped build.

## How to do it

```js
update() {
    if (BT.isDevMode && BT.isKeyPressed('KeyG')) {
        this.godMode = !this.godMode; // dev-only cheat key
    }
}

render() {
    // ...
    if (BT.isDevMode) {
        console.log('player', this.player.x, this.player.y); // dev-only verbose logging
    }
}
```

`BT.isDevMode` is a getter (no parentheses) and needs no setup beyond having `blit386/vite` installed - every scaffold
has it already (see `use-hot-reload`). It reads `true` while `npm run dev` is running the game through that plugin, and
`false` in a built/shipped game (`npm run build`).

## What dev mode turns on for you (engine 1.7.0+)

Two things come free with a dev build, without any code:

- **`window.BT`** - the engine puts itself on the page, so you can type `BT.ticks`, `BT.activeBackend`, or
  `BT.palette.get(1)` straight into the browser console and inspect the running game. It is not assigned in a built
  game. Override it either way with `bootstrap(Game, { exposeGlobal: true })` (or `false`) if you need to.
- **F9 / Shift+F9 frame capture** - F9 copies the current frame to the clipboard, Shift+F9 saves it as a PNG. Turn both
  off with `isFrameCaptureShortcutEnabled: false` in `configure()` when your game wants F9 for itself. See the
  `save-a-screenshot` skill.

Left alone, both follow `BT.isDevMode`, so neither ships to players by accident. Each also has an explicit override that
wins over that default - `exposeGlobal: true` for the first, `isFrameCaptureShortcutEnabled: true` for the second - if
you want one in a release build on purpose.

## Let an agent read the game's state (engine 1.7.2+)

Add a `testState()` method to your game class that returns what a play-tester needs to check, as plain JSON:

```js
testState() {
    return {
        score: this.score,
        lives: this.lives,
        player: { x: this.player.x, y: this.player.y },
    };
}
```

Then, in a dev build, `window.BT.testState()` in the browser console (or an agent's JavaScript call) returns
`{ ticks, backend, state }`: the engine's tick counter, the active backend, and a copy of what your method returned.
Read it twice about a second apart and `ticks` should have grown by about 60.

- Nothing else to wire up: no `window.__game`, no `declare global` block, no `if (BT.isDevMode)` around it. It rides on
  `window.BT`, which only a dev build has.
- Keep it plain JSON: numbers, strings, booleans, `null`, arrays, and plain objects. The engine copies the result, so a
  `Vector2i` arrives as `{ x, y }` and functions or `undefined` fields are dropped.
- Without the method, `state` is `null` and `ticks` and `backend` still work.
- If the method throws or returns something JSON cannot hold (an object that contains itself, a `BigInt`), the call
  still returns: `state` is `null`, `error` holds the message, and the browser console shows `[BT] testState() threw:`.
- It keeps working after a hot reload rebuilds the game object - the engine asks the current one every time.
- The engine never calls it on its own, so it costs nothing during play. See `test-the-game` for using it.

## Notes

- `BT.isDevMode` is tied to the dev server, not to `NODE_ENV` or any bundler define - there is nothing else to
  configure.
- It answers exactly one question: is this a dev build. It has nothing to do with your own game state (paused, in a
  menu, level number) - keep those as your own fields.
- The engine gates one thing on this by itself: the BLIT386 splash plays in a release build and not in a dev build. Add
  `?splash` to the URL to see it while developing, or turn it off for good with `isSplashEnabled: false` in
  `configure()`. See `docs/basics.md` (The splash).
- This is a convenience for you, the developer, not a security boundary. A player who really wants to could still flip
  it on in a shipped build; do not rely on it to hide content you actually need to protect.
- Needs blit386 `^1.5.0`.
