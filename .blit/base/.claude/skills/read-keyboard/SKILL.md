  Read keyboard keys and face buttons in update(). Use for keyboard movement, jumping, menus, typed text, or remapping
  keys, including raw key codes like 'KeyW', the default key mapping (W, A, S, D for player 0, arrow keys for player 1),
  and making the arrow keys steer player 0 in a one-player game (keyboardLayout: 'single').

# Read the keyboard

Read keys and face buttons in `update()`. For player 0, W, A, S, D already map to the D-pad and Space to `BTN_A`; the
arrow keys belong to player 1 by default. A one-player game that wants the arrows too sets `keyboardLayout: 'single'`
(see One-player game below).

## When to use

Use for keyboard movement, jumping, menus, typed text, or remapping keys.

## Face buttons (work on keyboard and gamepad)

```js
update() {
    if (BT.isDown(BT.BTN_RIGHT, 0)) this.x += 2; // held: movement
    if (BT.isPressed(BT.BTN_A, 0)) this.jump(); // one frame: jump/fire/confirm
    if (BT.isReleased(BT.BTN_A, 0)) this.release();
}
```

Player number is `0` for a one-player game. Directions: `BT.BTN_LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN`; actions: `BT.BTN_A/B/X/Y`.

## One-player game: WASD and the arrow keys

```js
configure() {
    return {
        keyboardLayout: 'single', // player 0: WASD and arrows; player 1: IJKL (engine 1.7.2+)
    };
}
```

`'single'` also stops the arrow keys scrolling the page (unless you set `isCapturingKeyboardScroll: false`). The
default, `'versus'`, keeps WASD for player 0 and the arrows for player 1 - right for a two-player keyboard game.

## Raw keys by name

Use the browser key code (`'KeyW'`, `'Space'`, `'ArrowUp'`, `'Enter'`):

```js
if (BT.isKeyDown('KeyW')) this.y -= 2; // held
if (BT.isKeyPressed('Enter')) this.start(); // one frame
if (BT.isKeyPressed('ArrowUp', 10)) this.menuUp(); // repeats every 10 ticks while held
```

## Typed text

```js
this.name += BT.inputString; // characters typed this frame (a getter)
```

## Remap a face button

```js
BT.inputMap(0, BT.BTN_A, 'KeyZ', 'Space'); // player, button, one or more key codes
BT.inputMap(0, BT.BTN_LEFT, 'KeyA', 'ArrowLeft'); // replaces the list, so keep 'KeyA' to keep WASD working
BT.inputMapReset(); // back to the keyboardLayout's defaults
```

## Key calls

- `BT.isKeyDown(code)` / `BT.isKeyPressed(code, repeat?)` / `BT.isKeyReleased(code)` - methods.
- `BT.isDown(button, player)` / `BT.isPressed(...)` / `BT.isReleased(...)` - methods (face buttons).
- `BT.inputString` - getter (typed characters).
- `BT.inputMap(player, button, ...keys)` / `BT.inputMapReset()` - methods (players 0-1 only).

## Notes

- Read input in `update()`, not `render()` - presses, releases, and typed text are one-frame events that already reset
  by the time `render()` runs, so checking them there can silently drop taps under fast input.
- "Down" means held every frame; "Pressed" / "Released" is the single edge frame.
- Arrow keys and Space scroll the host page by default. Set `isCapturingKeyboardScroll: true` in `configure()` when your
  game maps those keys so the page does not move while the canvas is focused (`keyboardLayout: 'single'` turns it on for
  you).

See `docs/input.md`.
